XING Ruby on Rails Coding Challenge
=====================================

Welcome to the coding challenge.

Welcome to the XING Coding Challenge! This challenge will give us an idea about your coding skills. You get access to this repository for 24 hours. Please plan around 3 hours for this challenge.

Prerequisites
--------------

- Important for us is code efficiency, following of best practices & code readability
- Please don't use scaffolding
- Do not focus too much on the design
- The usage of third party libraries is explicitly allowed
- Provide a comprehensive git history
- Commit directly to master and do not open a PR, then we can efficiently transfer the repo back to our GitHub Enterprise

Goals
-----

- Please create a very simple web application in Ruby on Rails 4 or 5. 
- The application should compare the current weather of 5 cities of your choice (fine to hard-wire the cities) and makes a recommendation, which of the cities currently has the best weather. 
- Feel free to add a readme that describes how your app works and what things you would add/change/do differently if you were given more time. 

Bonus Goals
------------

- Provide a basic set of meaningful tests
- Add a UI for users to set the compared cities (2-5)

Hints
------

- OpenWeatherMap has an API to get the current weather: https://openweathermap.org/current
